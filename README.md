# üìä Data Warehouse Project (Medallion Architecture)

## üèó Overview

This project implements a **Data Warehouse** using the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold)**.
We integrate two primary datasets:

* **CRM Dataset** ‚Üí Customer relationship data (leads, interactions, support tickets).
* **ERP Dataset** ‚Üí Enterprise resource planning data (orders, inventory, finance, suppliers).

The goal is to transform raw data into **clean, enriched, and analytics-ready datasets** for business reporting and advanced analytics.

## üî∑ 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data)

The **Bronze Layer** stores **raw, unprocessed data** directly ingested from source systems.

* **Purpose:**

  * Keep an immutable copy of source data.
  * Serve as the "single source of truth."
  * Allow reprocessing if needed.

* **Data Sources:**

  * **CRM:** Customer profiles, interactions, sales leads, support tickets.
  * **ERP:** Transactions, inventory movements, purchase orders, payments.

* **Storage Format:**

  * Typically in **parquet/CSV/json** format in data lake.
  * Partitioned by ingestion date.

* **Example Tables:**

  * `bronze.crm_customers_raw`
  * `bronze.crm_interactions_raw`
  * `bronze.erp_orders_raw`
  * `bronze.erp_inventory_raw`

## üî∂ 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Standardized Data)

The **Silver Layer** contains **cleaned, structured, and joined data**.

* **Purpose:**

  * Apply **data quality checks** (null handling, duplicates, formatting).
  * Create **conformed dimensions** (standard IDs across CRM & ERP).
  * Integrate data sources for consistency.

* **Transformations Applied:**

  * Remove duplicates & invalid records.
  * Standardize **customer IDs** across CRM & ERP.
  * Normalize date & time formats.
  * Apply business rules (e.g., map ERP orders to CRM customers).

* **Example Tables:**

  * `silver.customers` ‚Üí Unified view of CRM + ERP customers.
  * `silver.orders` ‚Üí Cleaned order transactions.
  * `silver.inventory` ‚Üí Standardized stock & movement records.
  * `silver.interactions` ‚Üí Customer interaction history.

---

## üü° 3. Gold Layer (Business Aggregates & Analytics)

The **Gold Layer** contains **business-level curated datasets** for reporting, dashboards, and ML models.

* **Purpose:**

  * Provide **domain-specific aggregated tables**.
  * Serve as inputs to BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, Looker).
  * Enable **KPI tracking**.

* **Example Business Aggregates:**

  * `gold.customer_360` ‚Üí Complete customer profile with ERP orders + CRM interactions.
  * `gold.sales_summary` ‚Üí Revenue by region, product, time.
  * `gold.inventory_health` ‚Üí Stock levels, reorder alerts, supplier performance.
  * `gold.support_performance` ‚Üí Ticket resolution times, customer satisfaction trends.

* **Use Cases:**

  * **CRM + ERP Integration** ‚Üí See full customer journey (lead ‚Üí order ‚Üí support).
  * **Finance & Sales Analytics** ‚Üí Revenue forecasting, churn prediction.
  * **Operations Optimization** ‚Üí Inventory management, supplier analysis.

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Medallion Architecture in this Project

* **Scalability:** Separate layers allow easy expansion of sources.
* **Data Quality:** Errors fixed in Silver ensure reliable Gold data.
* **Flexibility:** Analysts can query Bronze for raw exploration or Gold for insights.
* **Auditability:** Bronze acts as a backup for reprocessing.
